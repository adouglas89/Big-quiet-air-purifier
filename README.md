# Big-quiet-air-purifier
Big Quiet Air purifier/filtration machine, can be remotely managed/monitored, very high performance to cost ratio.
This uses a large axial fan with unprecedented flow to noise ratio at the pressure of concern - about 4-6 pascals, which is not much pressure.  It also gets relatively good flow at higher pressures for the noise, but you want to keep in this region if you can for highest CADR.

This system uses standard furnace filters, which are available in a wide range of MERV ratings, and even HEPA, in the same size and shape.  You can sub in whatever you want but probably there is a MERV rating that gives the best CADR.  It may or may not be MERV-13, but that's a good starting point.

The fan currently requires a large format printer.  Don't buy anything Tronxy, I can tell you that, they are the worst machines I have ever encountered and the company won't send you spare parts etc either.

Everything in this repository is going to go out of date as things are changing fast.

Actually making one is something that will become easier as the development is sorted out better.  If it's confusing that's no surprise, manufacturing is never easy, people don't respect it for some reason but they should.

The CAD files for the big quiet fan will also be integrated into this CAD file from now on.  The files in the repository specifically for the big quiet fan will eventually be obsolete unless I update them.
